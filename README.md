DXF and bending instructions for the laser cut stainless steel cybertruck

## Laser cutting
The DXF is already set up to be submitted to OSHCut.com. There is a layer called 'ENGRAVE' that has windows and signature. Select 304 Stainless Steel, #4 Finish and 20ga for the full size cybertruck.

For the miniature 8in version, select the 304 Stainless Steel, #4 Finish and 24ga. The 24ga should be easy enough to bend by hand. A pair of needle nose pliers can be helpful and make the process a little easier.
